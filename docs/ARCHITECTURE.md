# Architecture

How the system is shaped. Keep this current as the design settles — a fresh session reads this before
working on structure.

## Overview

The system consists of a parser library that reads Finale `.mus` and `.musx` files and exports
MusicXML, plus a frontend desktop application providing two functions:

- A hex viewer that decodes binary entries and shows the structure values
- A rendering of the corresponding music notation

Because parsing supports multiple inputs, all data flows into a single intermediate representation
(IR). The library stays independently usable and takes no GUI dependency.

## Modules

<!-- List the top-level modules under src/ and the single responsibility of each. -->

- `src/` — the main source directory.
- `src/finale_file_parser/version/` — identifies which Finale version wrote a file, before any
  record parsing. `models.py` (types), `family.py` (magic → family), `mus.py` (banner parsing),
  `musx.py` (archive metadata), `detect.py` (public entry).
- `src/finale_file_parser/container/` — owns all `.musx` archive access. `models.py`
  (`ContainerEntry`, `CorruptContainerError`), `names.py` (member-name safety), `musx.py`
  (`open_musx`, `MusxContainer`). `version/musx.py` is a client of this module; nothing else
  opens archives directly.

### Known format facts — version

- `.mus` begins with `ENIGMA BINARY FILE` at offset 0, identical across Finale 2001–2012. The
  writing version is an ASCII banner at offset `0x20`, e.g.
  `Finale(R) 2011 Copyright (c) 1987-2010 MakeMusic Inc.`
  Evidence: 238 corpus files; see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-version-detection-design.md`.
- That banner field is fixed-size and is **not** zero-filled on rewrite, so a shorter banner can
  leave a tail of the previous, longer one behind (observed: `logy` from the Finale 2004 Coda
  banner surviving into a 2005 file). Always cut at the first NUL.
- `.mus` carries two provenance stamps (date, application, platform) at fixed offsets: created —
  date `0x66`, application tag `0x70`, platform tag `0x74`; modified — date `0x8C`, application tag
  `0x96`, platform tag `0x9A`. The date is `[year - 1900, month, day]` as three `u8`. Present in
  238/238 corpus files, with `created <= modified` in all of them. **Platform is recoverable from
  `.mus`, not `.musx`-only** — an earlier version of this document recorded platform as available
  only from `.musx`; that was wrong. Corpus tally: `MAC` in 136 files, `WIN` in 102.
- 89 of the 136 `MAC` `.mus` files (0 of the 102 `WIN` files) end in a **macOS plist trailer**
  occupying the last 1-3% of the file (938-1694 bytes) — apparently appended OS-level metadata.
  Not parsed; recorded so the next investigation starts from it.
- **A hypothesis that did not survive testing:** `.mus` was suspected to share `.musx`'s
  record-type numbering (`10001`, `10002`, ...). Scanning all 238 files for those values as aligned
  little-endian `u16` gave occurrence rates close to the chance baseline expected in files dense
  with small integers and zero runs. The hypothesis is **not supported** — recorded here so it is
  not re-derived from the same coincidence.
- `.mus` has **no member table** — it is a monolithic binary with no directory and no confirmed
  record framing, unlike `.musx`. There is no container abstraction to build for it; locating any
  internal record pools remains open-ended research.
- `.musx` is a zip with `mimetype` = `application/vnd.makemusic.notation`. Version data lives in
  `NotationMetadata.xml` as plaintext, with separate `created` and `modified` blocks. **`modified`
  is the layout authority** — 264 of 401 corpus files were created by major=16 but last written by
  major=18.
- `score.dat` is obfuscated high-entropy data. Version detection never reads it.
- The `.musx` `major` version number (15/16/17/18) has no established mapping to Finale's
  marketing years (2009/2011/2012/2014...). Nothing in the corpus bridges the two schemes, so
  version labels report the raw major/maint/build instead of a year. Open question.
- `scripts/build_version_fixtures.py` strips `NotationMetadata.xml` down to only the root
  `version` attribute and the `created`/`modified` subtrees, building the output tree fresh so any
  field not explicitly listed is absent by construction. Every attribute on every element within
  those subtrees is also stripped (an allowlist of zero attributes — none are read by version
  detection, so none are kept), and every `<modifiedBy>` is blanked rather than dropped. This is
  deliberate: the corpus metadata carries `title`, `subtitle`, `composer`, `arranger`, `lyricist`,
  `copyright` (including a MakeMusic notice restricting commercial redistribution), and
  `modifiedBy` — which holds real people's initials in 28 corpus files — plus attributes such as
  `<created author="...">` that could carry the same kind of identifying data. Do not loosen this
  filter to pass through more fields or attributes.

### Known format facts — the .musx container

Evidence: all 401 corpus archives, surveyed 2026-07-21. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-musx-container-design.md`.

- A `.musx` is a zip. `mimetype` is always the **first** member and always **stored
  uncompressed** (401/401) — the ODF/EPUB convention. Member order is structural; do not
  assume alphabetical. This is an *observed* fact, asserted of the fixtures and the corpus by
  tests — `open_musx` deliberately does not enforce `mimetype`'s position or its compression
  method, so a future Finale variant that reorders members stays inspectable rather than being
  rejected outright.
- Members observed: `mimetype`, `META-INF/container.xml`, `NotationMetadata.xml`, `score.dat`,
  `presets/<n>.preset`, `graphics/<n>.jpg`. Archives embed images, so container content is not
  limited to notation.
- Member count 5-10; per-archive uncompressed total 89 KB - 420 KB; `score.dat` 86 KB - 413 KB.
- 22 distinct **ordered sequences of member names**. This is measured by name and order only —
  not by (name, size, compress method) — because size and method vary between archives that share
  the same name sequence, which would otherwise inflate the count. Comparing *sorted* name sets
  instead of ordered sequences gives 18 and discards ordering, which is meaningful here: this
  distinction caused a real bug during implementation.
- `score.dat` is high-entropy obfuscated data and barely compresses. It is extracted, never
  interpreted, at this layer.
- No corpus archive has duplicate or unsafe member names, so the reader's safety checks cannot be
  exercised by real files — they are covered by synthetic hostile input and verified by mutation.

## Data flow

<!-- Describe the path of the core operation, input to output, naming the key types. -->

```
.mus  ────────────────▶ parser ──▶ IR ──▶ MusicXML
.musx ──▶ EnigmaXML ──▶ parser ──▶ IR ──▶ MusicXML
```

Both inputs converge on the same IR, so format-specific handling stays inside the readers and never
reaches the exporters. Key types are named here as they are defined.
