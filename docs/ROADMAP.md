# Roadmap

The build order. Ship the MVP path end-to-end **first**, then layer features. A fresh session should
read this to know what to work on next.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (done by the scaffold)

- [x] Repo structure, CLAUDE.md, docs/, Makefile, tests, CI, `.remember/`.

## Phase 1 — MVP: read the `.musx` container

Goal: given a path to a `.musx` file, open it and hand back its internal streams, with malformed
input failing cleanly. No musical interpretation yet — this is the foundation everything else reads
through. Each item is one branch / one PR.

- [x] Version detection for `.mus` and `.musx` (`detect_version`). Landed ahead of the container
      reader below.
- [x] `open_musx(path)` — open and structurally validate a `.musx` container. Raises
      `NotFinaleFileError` (not a Finale file) or `CorruptContainerError` (a Finale file violating
      a safety limit). The earlier `InvalidFinaleFile` name was dropped in favour of reusing the
      existing error type.
- [x] Enumerate the container's entries (name, declared size, compressed size, method) in archive
      order.
- [x] Extract the score stream as bytes, with size caps applied before reading.
- [x] Synthetic container fixtures harvested from corpus *structure* — this replaced "author a
      public-domain fixture", which needed a working Finale install. Structure-only harvesting is
      what makes CI coverage possible without committing a real score.
- [x] Document the container layout in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, with evidence.

Done when: a test opens the fixture, lists its entries, pulls the score stream, and a second test
proves a truncated/garbage file raises `InvalidFinaleFile` rather than crashing.

## Later

<!-- Things deliberately deferred. Keep them out of Phase 1 so the MVP stays small. -->
- [ ] Decode the score stream into records/chunks (needs the Phase 1 bytes first).
- [ ] Notes, pitches, and rhythms as a Python data model.
- [ ] Staves, measures, and score structure.
- [ ] Legacy `.mus` reader behind the same public API (see DECISIONS.md — open).
- [ ] MusicXML exporter over the IR (DECIDED — see DECISIONS.md).
- [ ] Desktop frontend: hex viewer with decoded structure values (DECIDED — framework still open).
- [ ] Desktop frontend: notation rendering.
- [ ] CLI for dumping file structure.
